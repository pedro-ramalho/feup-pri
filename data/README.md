# About

The project aims to use information analysis techniques to uncover insights about fungi in the Iberian Peninsula. In the following sections you may find a description about our data sources.

## Sources

### Structured Data

- [GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility)](www.gbif.org)

### Unstructured Data

For unstructured data, the goal was to extract the "Abstract" section of scientific articles related to fungi species. The source used was Google Scholar. Since this platform does not have a public open API, a manual scraping was performed instead.
