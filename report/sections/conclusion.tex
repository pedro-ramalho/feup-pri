\section{Conclusion}

After selecting the source and datasets to be used, cleaning and processing the data, our pipeline returns a collection of documents containing valuable information to be used in our search system. The search platform using this collection, with customized indexation and tools for information retrieval is able to return relevant information, as we've evaluated in accordance to the user's information needs. There is room for future improvement, such as refining the information retrieval process, making the search system more robust, or even broadening the search possibilities through additional data or features.
