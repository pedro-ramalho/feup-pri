\section{Introduction}

In this study we address the intersection of information retrieval and mycology, focusing on the extensive vital class of organisms, fungi. Fungi play diverse roles in ecosystems, from supporting plant life to providing valuable pharmaceutical compounds.

To streamline data access, we leverage the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) \cite{GBIF}, an international data infrastructure committed to open access to a broad array of datasets \cite{Dataset} from multiple authoritative sources. GBIF enables precise searches and the retrieval of curated data subsets. With these resources, our goal is to develop a specialized search engine tailored to fungal species and occurrences. We concentrate our efforts on specific geographical regions, namely Portugal and Spain, to compile a comprehensive dataset. Additionally, we plan to utilize Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for supplementary data collection.
