\begin{abstract}
  %This report details the development of the first milestone of our project, developed as part of the Information Processing and Retrieval curricular unit. This milestone encompasses the selection, preparation, and characterization of a dataset. It will result in a reproducible pipeline for data processing, the output of which is a collection of documents that will act as a base for the subsequent milestones. We have selected a dataset which compiles occurrences of different species of Fungi in Portugal and Spain.

  This project aims to introduce an information search system on fungi, developed on top of data collected from publicly accessible sources. The development process includes preparation and processing of this data to ensure it's quality and relevance. This search system is expected to fulfill the various information needs of a broad range of end users interested in knowing more about the fungal diversity and distribution in the context of the Iberian Peninsula.

\section{Milestone 1 - Data preparation}

The first milestone encompasses the selection, preparation, and characterization of a dataset. It results in a reproducible pipeline for data processing, the output of which is a collection of documents that will serve as a base for the subsequent milestones.

\section{Milestone 2 - Information Retrieval}

The second milestone focuses on the collection and indexing of data in the search engine, as well as the information retrieval process and it's subsequent evaluation. For this project, Apache Solr \cite{Solr} was chosen as a search platform.
