This research serves to detect the lethal impacts of Amanita \npantherina(DC.:Fr) Schrmm.(Agaricales, Amanitaceae, Amanita), Amanita \nvirgineoides Bas (Agaricales, Amanitaceae, Amanita), Coprinus comatus \n(O.F.M\u00fcll.)

(Phallales, Phallaceae, Phallus) on Drosophila \nmelanogaster(Diptera, Drosophilidae, Drosophila), including their effects on \nlifespan, fecundity, offspring growth and developmental characteristics, \nantioxidant enzyme activity, peroxide content, and the gene transcription \nassociated with signaling pathways and lifespan of D. melanogaster. The results \ndemonstrated that they all produced lethal effects on D. melanogaster. Female \nflies were more sensitive to the addition of macrofungi to their diet and have a \nshorter survival time than male flies. The toxic activity of A. \npantherina-supplemented diet was the strongest, so that the D. melanogaster in \nthis group had no offspring. The macrofungal-supplemented diets were able to \nsignificantly reduce the activity of antioxidant enzymes, accumulate \nperoxidation products, up-regulatd the transcription of genes related to \nsignaling pathways, inhibit the expression of longevity genes, reduce the \nlifespan and fertility of D. melanogaster. Consequently, we hypothetically \nsuggest that medicinal C. comatus, P. cinnabarinus and P. rubicundus hold the \npotential to be developed into an environmentally friendly biopesticide for fly \nkilling.\n\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2023.

As part of our systematic study on Korean mushrooms, \na chemical investigation of A. pantherina fruiting bodies resulted in the \nisolation and structural identification of three new fatty acid derivatives, \npantheric acids A-C (1-3), and a known compound, 1,10-dimethyl \nester-2-decenedioic acid (4). Although 1,10-dimethyl ester-2-decenedioic acid \n(4) was previously reported as a synthetic product, it was structurally \nidentified from a natural source for the first time. The structures of the new \ncompounds were established by detailed analysis of 1D and 2D (1H-1H COSY, HSQC, \nand HMBC) NMR, HRMS, and LC/MS/MS data. The absolute configurations of compounds \n1 and 2 were unambiguously determined by a recently developed method using \ncompeting enantioselective acylation coupled with LC/MS analysis. The isolated \ncompounds (1-4) were evaluated for their effects on lipid accumulation during \nadipocyte maturation. Pantheric acids A-C (1-3) promoted the enlargement of \nlipid droplets in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and altered lipid metabolism by inducing \nlipogenesis and inhibiting lipolysis. Our findings provide experimental evidence \nsuggesting the potential adverse effects of pantheric acids A-C from a poisonous \nmushroom on lipid metabolism.\n\nDOI: 10.1021/acs.jnatprod.9b00782\nPMID: 31724396 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Although it is well known that ECM fungi can \nobtain K and P from soil minerals through biological weathering, the mechanisms \nregulating this process are still poorly understood at the molecular level. \nHere, we investigated the transcriptional regulation of the ECM fungus Amanita \npantherina in weathering K-containing feldspar and apatite using transcriptome \nsequencing (RNA-seq) and validated these results for differentially expressed \ngenes using real-time quantitative PCR. The results showed that A. pantherina \nwas able to improve relevant metabolic processes, such as promoting the \nbiosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and steroids in the weathering of \nK-containing feldspar and apatite. The expression of genes encoding ion \ntransporters was markedly enhanced during exposure to solid K-containing \nfeldspar and apatite, and transcripts of the high-affinity K transporter ApHAK1, \nbelonging to the HAK family, were significantly upregulated. The results also \ndemonstrated that there was no upregulation of organic acid biosynthesis, \nreflecting the weak weathering capacity of the A. pantherina isolate used in \nthis study, especially its inability to utilize P in apatite. Our findings \nsuggest that under natural conditions in forests, some ECM fungi with low \nweathering potential of their own may instead enhance the uptake of mineral \nnutrients using their high-affinity ion transporter systems.IMPORTANCE In this \nstudy, we revealed the molecular mechanism and possible strategies of A. \npantherina with weak weathering potential in the uptake of insoluble mineral \nnutrients by using transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) technology and found that \nApHAK1, a K transporter gene of this fungus, plays a very important role in the \nacquisition of K and P. Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi play critical roles in the \nuptake of woody plant nutrients in forests that are usually characterized by \nnutrient limitation and in maintaining the stability of forest ecosystems. \nHowever, the regulatory mechanisms of ECM fungi in acquiring nutrients from \nminerals/rocks are poorly understood.

Cytotoxicity studies demonstrated a selective effect of \nastrakurkurol with towering influence in HepG2 than Thle2 cells. The exposure of \nthese triterpene-induced marked apoptotic morphological changes enhanced the \nrate of cell apoptosis and arrest cell cycle at G0/G1. Furthermore, these \nresults are aided by decline in the expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL with an increase \nin the expression of p53, Bax, Fas, FADD together with the activation of caspase \ncascade.

Usually lanostane-type triterpenoids from mushrooms had prospective \nfor cancer disease treatments. Recently, a triterpenoid, astrakurkurol obtained \nfrom the fresh basidiocarps of the edible mushroom Astraeus hygrometricus, drew \nattention as a new cytotoxic therapeutic. The structural stability of this \ntriterpenoid had been established with the amalgamation of density functional \ntheory (DFT) calculations and study of single-crystal X-ray diffraction. To \nsuccessfully manifest astrakurkurol as a potent cytotoxic therapeutics, a wide \napprehension on the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying their action is \nprerequisite. On this account, our study was directed to scrutinize the \ninfluence of this triterpenoid on human hepatocellular cancer cell model Hep3B. \nEncapsulating all experimental facts revealed that astrakurkurol had \nsignificantly decreased cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner. This \neffect was unveiled to be apoptosis, documented by DNA fragmentation, chromatin \ncondensation, nuclear shrinkage, membrane blebing, and imbalance of cell cycle \ndistribution. Astrakurkurol persuaded the expression of death receptor \nassociated proteins (Fas), which triggered caspase-8 activation following tBid \ncleavage. Moreover, tBid mediated ROS generation, which triggered mitochondrial \ndysfunction and activated the mitochondrial apoptotic events. Astrakurkurol \ncytotoxicity was based on caspase-8-mediated intrinsic apoptotic pathway and was \nassociated with inhibition at Akt and NF-\u03baB pathway. Astrakurkurol had also \ninhibited the migration of Hep3B cells, indicating its antimigratory potential. \nThese findings led us to introduce astrakurkurol as a feasible and natural \nsource for a safer cytotoxic drug against hepatocellular carcinoma.\n\nDOI: 10.1021/acs.jafc.9b01203\nPMID: 31250646 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

The current systematics are mainly based \non macromorphology, and is not significantly different from that proposed by \nVittadini (1831). Within the 49 species recognised worldwide, 23 were originally \ndescribed from Europe and 17 of these were described before the 20th century. \nMoreover, very recent phylogenetic treatments of the genus are mainly based on a \nfew extra-European species and most common European species are still poorly \ndocumented. Based on an extensive taxonomic sampling mainly made in the \nbiogeographically rich Cantabrian area (Spain), complemented with collections \nfrom France, Greece, Italy, Norway, Portugal and Sweden, all currently \nrecognized species in Europe have been sequenced at the ITS and 28S of the rDNA. \nCombined phylogenetic analyses yielded molecular support to sections Elaphomyces \nand Ceratogaster (here emended), while a third, basal lineage encompasses the \nsections Malacodermei and Ascoscleroderma as well as the tropical genus \nPseudotulostoma. Species limits are discussed and some taxa formerly proposed as \ngenuine species based on morphology and biogeography are re-evaluated as \nvarieties or forms. Spore size and ornamentation, features of the peridial \nsurface, structure of the peridium, and the presence of mycelium patches \nattached to the peridial surface emerge as the most significant systematic \ncharacters.

        "summary": "Astraeus hygrometricus, commonly known as the hygroscopic earthstar, the barometer earthstar, or the false earthstar, is a species of fungus in the family Diplocystaceae. Young specimens resemble a puffball when unopened. In maturity, the mushroom displays the characteristic earthstar shape that is a result of the outer layer of fruit body tissue splitting open in a star-like manner. The false earthstar is an ectomycorrhizal species that grows in association with various trees, especially in sandy soils. A. hygrometricus was previously thought to have a cosmopolitan distribution, though it is now thought to be restricted to Southern Europe, and Astraeus are common in temperate and tropical regions. Its common names refer to the fact that it is hygroscopic (water-absorbing) and can open up its rays to expose the spore sac in response to increased humidity, then close them up again in drier conditions. The rays have an irregularly cracked surface, while the spore case is pale brown and smooth with an irregular slit or tear at the top. The gleba is white initially, but turns brown and powdery when the spores mature. The spores are reddish-brown and roughly spherical with minute warts, measuring 7.5\u201311 micrometers in diameter.\nDespite a similar overall appearance, A. hygrometricus is not related to the true earthstars of genus Geastrum, although historically, they have been taxonomically confused. The species was first described by Christiaan Hendrik Persoon in 1801 as Geastrum hygrometricus. In 1885, Andrew P. Morgan proposed that differences in microscopic characteristics warranted the creation of a new genus Astraeus distinct from Geastrum; this opinion was not universally accepted by later authorities. Several Asian populations formerly thought to be A. hygrometricus were renamed in the 2000s once phylogenetic analyses revealed they were unique Astraeus species, including A. asiaticus and A. odoratus. Similarly, in 2013, North American populations were divided into A. pteridis, A. morganii, and A. smithii on the basis of molecular phylogenetics. This research suggests that the type specimen of Astraeus hygrometricus originates in a population restricted to Europe between Southern France and Turkey, with A. telleriae found nearby in Spain and Greece. Research has revealed the presence of several bioactive chemical compounds in Astraeus fruit bodies. North American field guides typically rate A. hygrometricus as inedible; while this may be accurate for the now-separate North American species, A. hygrometricus is commonly consumed in South and Southeast Asia.",

The effects of SGME on taste enhancement as \nperceived by trained descriptive panelists and general consumers were evaluated \nin salt solutions and clear chicken soups.

Glutamic acid, aspartic acids, adenosine 5'-monophosphate \n(5'-AMP), and guanosine 5'-monophosphate (5'-GMP) contributed to SGME's umami \ntaste. As perceived by trained panelists, saltiness enhancement caused by SGME \nin aqueous solutions occurred only at relatively low salt concentrations (0.3 \nand 0.5%), while its umami enhancement effect was more pronounced. When SGME was \nadded into reduced-salt seasoned clear chicken soups, it helped to enhance both \nthe salty and umami tastes of the soups.

LPMOs are prevalent in nature, \nand the functional variation among these enzymes is a topic of great interest. \nWe present the functional characterization of one of the 22 putative AA9-type \nLPMOs from the fungus Schizophyllum commune, ScLPMO9A. The enzyme, expressed in \nEscherichia coli, showed C4-oxidative cleavage of amorphous cellulose and \nsoluble cello-oligosaccharides. Activity on xyloglucan, mixed-linkage \u03b2-glucan, \nand glucomannan was also observed, and product profiles differed compared to the \nwell-studied C4-oxidizing NcLPMO9C from Neurospora crassa. While NcLPMO9C is \nalso active on more crystalline forms of cellulose, ScLPMO9A is not. Differences \nbetween the two enzymes were also revealed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) \ntitration studies showing that, in contrast to NcLPMO9C, ScLPMO9A has higher \naffinity for linear substrates compared to branched substrates. Studies of \nH2O2-fueled degradation of amorphous cellulose showed that ScLPMO9A catalyzes a \nfast and specific peroxygenase reaction that is at least two orders of magnitude \nfaster than the apparent monooxygenase reaction. Together, these results show \nthat ScLPMO9A is an efficient LPMO with a broad substrate range, which, rather \nthan acting on cellulose, has evolved to act on amorphous and soluble glucans.\n\n\u00a9 2023.

Among twenty-three tested mushrooms \nagainst A. niger, B. cinerea, F. oxysporum, and G. bidwellii, Schizophyllum \ncommune demonstrated highest inhibition rates and showed 35.7%, 6.5%, 50.4%, and \n66.0% of growth inhibition, respectively. To reveal culture conditions enhancing \nthe antifungal potential of Sch. commune, several carbon (lignocellulosic \nsubstrates among them) and nitrogen sources and their optimal concentrations \nwere investigated. Presence of 6% mandarin juice production waste (MJPW) and 6% \nof peptone in nutrient medium promoted antifungal activity of selected mushroom. \nIt was determined that, extracts obtained in the presence of MJPW effectively \ninhibited the grow of pathogenic fungi. Moreover, the content of phenolic \ncompounds in the extracts obtained from Sch. commune grown on MJPW was several \ntimes higher (0.87 \u00b1 0.05 GAE/g to 2.38 \u00b1 0.08 GAE/g) than the extracts obtained \nfrom the mushroom grown on the synthetic (glycerol contained) nutrient medium \n(0.21 \u00b1 0.03 GAE/g to 0.88 \u00b1 0.05 GAE/g).

Identification \nof phenolic compounds composition in water and ethanol extracts were provided by \nmass spectrometry analysis. Extracts demonstrate considerable free radical \nscavenging activities and the IC50 values were generally low for the extracts, \nranging from 1.9 mg/ml to 6.7 mg/ml. All the samples displayed a positive \ncorrelation between their concentration (0.05-15.0 mg/ml) and DPPH radical \nscavenging activity.

However, the mechanisms of EPS synthesis \nand release in anaerobic environments remain poorly understood. Here, we provide \nthe first evidence of anaerobic EPS synthesis by the fungus Schizophyllum \ncommune 20R-7-F01, isolated from coal-bearing sediments ~2.0\u00a0km below the \nseafloor. Under anaerobic conditions, the fungus exhibited significantly higher \nspecific EPS production (1.57 times) than under aerobic conditions. \nTranscriptomic analysis revealed 2057 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in \nthe strain cultured anaerobically for 7\u00a0days compared to aerobically. Among \nthese genes, 642 were significantly upregulated, while 1415 were significantly \ndownregulated, mainly associated with carbon metabolism pathways. Genes involved \nin glycolysis and EPS synthesis, including hexokinase (HK), phosphoglucomutase \n(PGM), and (1\u00a0\u2192\u00a03)-\u03b2-glucan synthase (GLS), were significantly upregulated, \nwhile those related to the TCA cycle, respiratory chain, and pentose phosphate \npathway were downregulated under anaerobic conditions.

Production of laccases and peroxidases was \nstatistically significant in nitrogen-limiting media with and without the \nsubstrate, across all white-rot fungal cultures at 95% confidence interval. \nNitrogen-limiting media with the substrate on analysis extracellularly expressed \n99.27 U of laccase and 68.48 U of manganese peroxidase in Schizophyllum commune, \nwhile 195.14 U of lignin peroxidase was produced by Phanerochaete chrysosporium. \nLentinus squarrosulus expressed 455.34 U of laccase and 357.13 U of versatile \nperoxidase with 250.09 U of laccase and 206.95 U of manganese peroxidase \nproduced by Ganoderma racenaceum for every milliliter of the media used. \nNitrogen-limiting media triggered the production of laccase during the initial \nstages of growth while the expression of peroxidases was predominant at a later \nstage. Also, this media evinced increased enzymatic yields with low biomass \ncontent compared to nitrogen-excess conditions. The extant study confirmed the \npositive influence of nitrogen-limiting media in the efficient production of \nligninolytic enzymes and their suggestive degradation potential for \nenvironmental pollutants, making these enzymes a safe, clean alternative to the \nuse of chemicals and the media to be effective for large-scale production of \nligninolytic enzymes. IMPORTANCE Lignin on account of its high abundance, \ncomplex polymeric structure, and biochemical properties is identified as a \npromising candidate in renewable energy and bioproduct manufacturing. However, \ndepolymerization of lignin remains a major challenge in lignin utilization, \nentailing the employment of harsh treatments representing not only an \nenvironmental concern but also a waste of economic potential. Developing an \nalternative green technology to minimize this impact is imperative. Methods \nusing enzymes to depolymerize lignin are the focus of recent studies. Current \nresearch work emphasized the efficient expression of the major \nlignin-depolymerizing enzymes: laccases, lignin peroxidases, manganese \nperoxidases, and versatile peroxidases from native isolates of white-rot fungus \nfor several biotechnological applications as well as treatment of crop residues \nfor use as ruminant feed in improving productivity. The importance of nitrogen \nin augmenting the expression of lignin-depolymerizing enzymes and providing a \nmedia recipe for the cost-effective production of ligninolytic enzymes is \nhighlighted.\n\nDOI: 10.1128/spectrum.01419-23\nPMCID: PMC10581151\nPMID: 37655898\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflict of interest.",

In recent years, \nincreasing research effort has been employed to probe the relationship between \nthe development of macrofungi and TFs. Herein, the present review \ncomprehensively summarized the functional TFs researched in macrofungi, \nincluding modulating mycelial growth, fructification, sclerotial formation, \nsexual reproduction, spore formation, and secondary metabolism. Meanwhile, the \npossible effect mechanisms of TFs on the growth and development of some \nmacrofungi were also revealed. Specific examples of functional characterizations \nof TFs in macrofungi (such as Schizophyllum commune and Coprinopsis cinerea) \nwere described to a better comprehension of regulatory effect.

Considering the possible \nbiotechnological use of this enzyme, here we report its antifungal activity \nagainst virulent fungi affecting crops of economic interest. Our results show \nthat ageritin (200 \u00b5g/plug; ~13.5 nmole) inhibits the growth of Botrytis cinerea \n(57%), Colletotrichum truncatum (42%), and Alternaria alternata (57%), when \ntested on potato dextrose agar plates. At the same time, no effect was observed \nagainst Trichoderma harzianum (a fungus promoting beneficial effects in plants). \nTo verify whether the antifungal action of ageritin against B. cinerea and T. \nharzianum was due to ribosome damage, we tested ageritin in vitro on partially \nisolated B. cinerea and T. harzianum ribosomes. Interestingly, ageritin was able \nto release the Endo's fragment from both tested fungal ribosomes. We therefore \ndecided to test the antifungal effect of ageritin on B. cinerea and T. harzianum \nusing a different growth condition (liquid medium). Differently from the result \nin solid medium, ageritin can inhibit both B. cinerea and T. harzianum fungal \ngrowth in liquid medium in a concentration-dependent manner up to 35.7% and \n38.7%, respectively, at the highest concentration tested (~200 \u00b5g/mL; 12 \u00b5M), \nand the analysis of RNA isolated from ageritin-treated cells revealed the \npresence of Endo's fragment, highlighting its ability to cross the fungal cell \nwall and reach the ribosomes. Overall, these data highlight that the efficacy of \nantifungal treatment to prevent or treat a potential fungal disease may depend \nnot only on the fungal species but also on the conditions of toxin application.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/toxins15090578\nPMCID: PMC10535218\nPMID: 37756004 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors have no conflict of interest to \ndeclare.",

In spite of more than a century of \nresearch, our understanding of the molecular details of fruiting body \nmorphogenesis is still limited and a general synthesis on the genetics of this \ncomplex process is lacking. In this paper, we aim at a comprehensive \nidentification of conserved genes related to fruiting body morphogenesis and \ndistil novel functional hypotheses for functionally poorly characterised ones. \nAs a result of this analysis, we report 921 conserved developmentally expressed \ngene families, only a few dozens of which have previously been reported to be \ninvolved in fruiting body development. Based on literature data, conserved \nexpression patterns and functional annotations, we provide hypotheses on the \npotential role of these gene families in fruiting body development, yielding the \nmost complete description of molecular processes in fruiting body morphogenesis \nto date. We discuss genes related to the initiation of fruiting, \ndifferentiation, growth, cell surface and cell wall, defence, transcriptional \nregulation as well as signal transduction. Based on these data we derive a \ngeneral model of fruiting body development, which includes an early, \nproliferative phase that is mostly concerned with laying out the mushroom body \nplan (via cell division and differentiation), and a second phase of growth via \ncell expansion as well as meiotic events and sporulation. Altogether, our \ndiscussions cover 1 480 genes of Coprinopsis cinerea, and their orthologs in \nAgaricus bisporus, Cyclocybe aegerita, Armillaria ostoyae, Auriculariopsis \nampla, Laccaria bicolor, Lentinula edodes, Lentinus tigrinus, Mycena \nkentingensis, Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Pleurotus ostreatus, and \nSchizophyllum commune, providing functional hypotheses for ~10 % of genes in the \ngenomes of these species. Although experimental evidence for the role of these \ngenes will need to be established in the future, our data provide a roadmap for \nguiding functional analyses of fruiting related genes in the Agaricomycetes. We \nanticipate that the gene compendium presented here, combined with developments \nin functional genomics approaches will contribute to uncovering the genetic \nbases of one of the most spectacular multicellular developmental processes in \nfungi.

Lange) Imbach) is one of the \nwidely consumed edible mushrooms. Indeed, A. bisporus fruiting bodies are a rich \nsource of nutrients and bioactive molecules. In addition, several enzymes with \nbiotechnological applications are found in A. bisporus (e.g., enzymes for \nlignocellulose degradation). Here, a novel ribotoxin-like protein (RL-P) from \nthe edible mushroom A. bisporus was purified and characterized. This RL-P, named \nbisporitin, is a monomeric protein (17-kDa) exhibiting specific ribonucleolytic \nactivity by releasing the \u03b1-fragment (hallmark of RL-Ps) when incubated with \nrabbit ribosomes. In addition, bisporitin shows magnesium-dependent endonuclease \nactivity and displays a similar far-UV CD spectrum as ageritin, the prototype of \nRL-Ps, isolated from Cyclocybe aegerita fruiting bodies. Interestingly, \nbisporitin is the first member of RL-Ps to have noticeably lower thermal \nstability (Tm = 48.59 \u00b1 0.98 \u00b0C) compared to RL-Ps isolated in other mushrooms \n(Tm > 70 \u00b0C). Finally, this protein is only partially hydrolyzed in an in vitro \ndigestive system and does not produce adverse growing effects on eukaryotic cell \nlines. This evidence paves the way for future investigations on possible \nbioactivities of this RL-P in the digestive system.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/biom13020237\nPMCID: PMC9953402\nPMID: 36830606 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflict of interest.",

Agrocybe aegerita) is a \nwhite-rot fungus that naturally fruits from woody substrates, including buried \nwood. It is known for its substrate versatility and is equipped with a \nrespective carbohydrate-active enzyme repertoire being intermediate between \ntypical white-rot fungi and plant litter decomposers. Given relative nitrogen \nscarcity in wood, mobilization of nitrogen from surrounding litter is known as a \nway to meet nitrogen requirements for cellular homeostasis and reproduction of \nwood decay fungi. However, the effect of added nitrogen on vegetative and \nreproductive biomass has not yet been studied in a uniform minimalistic \nlaboratory setup. For C. aegerita, such a growth and fruiting setup has been \ndeveloped. In the present study, this white-rot fungus has been grown with and \nwithout additional \u03b2-adenosine, an organic nitrogen source present in plant \nlitter. Elevated \u03b2-adenosine levels increased aerial mycelium weight by 30% (1 \u00d7 \n\u03b2-adenosine) and 55% (10 \u00d7 \u03b2-adenosine), reproductive biomass by 75% (1 \u00d7 \n\u03b2-adenosine) and by 100% (10 \u00d7 \u03b2-adenosine), number of primordia by 127% (10 \u00d7 \n\u03b2-adenosine) and accelerated primordium formation by 1.6 days (10 \u00d7 \n\u03b2-adenosine), compared to the control treatment. These findings imply that C. \naegerita invests additional organic nitrogen resources into direct vegetative \nand reproductive biomass build-up at the same time. Colonization of niches with \naccessory nitrogen sources, like buried wood, which is near the plant litter \nlayer, may thus provide an evolutionary fitness advantage.

However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms and \ntheir species-dependence, especially among fungi of the phylum Basidiomycota. \nHence, we analyzed the effects of seven bacterial isolates, that were previously \nobtained from Pleurotus ostreatus HK35, on the mycelial growth of P. ostreatus \nHK35, Pleurotus eryngii DSMZ 8264, Pleurotus sapidus DSMZ 8266, Pleurotus \ncitrinopileatus DSMZ 5341, Cyclocybe aegerita AAE-3, Lentinula edodes CBS 389.89 \nand Kuehneromyces mutabilis DSMZ 1013 during eight days. Notably, the bacterial \nisolates only showed significant mycelial growth-promoting effects when \nco-cultivated on Petri dishes with Pleurotus species, except for P. \ncitrinopileatus. In particular, Paenibacillus peoriae strain M48F induced \nremarkably the mycelial growth in P. ostreatus (\u223c47 %), P. eryngii (\u223c32 %) and \nP. sapidus (\u223c27 %) during the early cultivation stages, but with ongoing \ncultivation this strain inhibited the growth of all fungi. To investigate the \nimpact of bacterial volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on the mycelial growth, P. \nostreatus and P. eryngii were co-cultivated with the bacteria on bi-plates. No \ngrowth inhibition on bi-plates was observed while bacterial isolates and mycelia \nwere separated by a physical barrier, assuring that late mycelial growth \ninhibition was not caused by bacterial volatile compounds. VOCs from strain M48F \ninduced the strongest growth of P. ostreatus (\u223c50 %) and P. eryngii (\u223c20 %) \nmycelia compared to controls. Furthermore, we analyzed the VOCs of strain M48F \nalone and in combination with P. ostreatus, P. eryngii, P. sapidus and L. edodes \nusing bi-plates and SPME-GC-MS. Strain M48F triggered the formation of \n\u03b2-bisabolene when co-cultivated with P. ostreatus or P. eryngii, which may \nindicate a fungal defense reaction. Additionally, 2,5-diisopropylpyrazine \ndominated the volatilome of strain M48F on all eight sampling days. In samples \nof strain M48F, alone and co-cultivated with L. edodes, the amount of \n2,5-diisopropylpyrazine remained quite constant. In contrast, the quantity of \nthis substance declined substantially in co-cultures with P. ostreatus. \nInterestingly, 2,5-diisopropylpyrazine enhanced P. ostreatus mycelial growth \nsignificantly although the growth-promoting effect was not as pronounced as \nduring co-cultivation with strain M48F. Our results show that the mycelial \ngrowth-promoting effects of bacteria are remarkably species-dependent, and that \nbacterial VOCs such as 2,5-diisopropylpyrazine can enhance mycelial growth.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors.

To \nelucidate the so far barely understood biosynthesis of fungal volatiles, \nalterations in the transcriptome during different developmental stages of C. \naegerita were analyzed and combined with changes in the volatile profile during \nits different fruiting stages.\nRESULTS: A transcriptomic study at seven points in time during fruiting body \ndevelopment of C. aegerita with seven mycelial and five fruiting body stages was \nconducted. Differential gene expression was observed for genes involved in \nfungal fruiting body formation showing interesting transcriptional patterns and \ncorrelations of these fruiting-related genes with the developmental stages. \nCombining transcriptome and volatilome data, enzymes putatively involved in the \nbiosynthesis of C8 oxylipins in C. aegerita including lipoxygenases (LOXs), \ndioxygenases (DOXs), hydroperoxide lyases (HPLs), alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) \nand ene-reductases could be identified. Furthermore, we were able to localize \nthe mycelium as the main source for sesquiterpenes predominant during \nsporulation in the headspace of C. aegerita cultures. In contrast, changes in \nthe C8 profile detected in late stages of development are probably due to the \nactivity of enzymes located in the fruiting bodies.\nCONCLUSIONS: In this study, the combination of volatilome and transcriptome data \nof C. aegerita revealed interesting candidates both for functional \ngenetics-based analysis of fruiting-related genes and for prospective enzyme \ncharacterization studies to further elucidate the so far barely understood \nbiosynthesis of fungal C8 oxylipins.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12864-021-07648-5\nPMCID: PMC8097960\nPMID: 33947322 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that they have no competing \ninterests.",

Cyanolichens \nare known for their heightened susceptibility to environmental pollution. We \nfocus here on the impacts on cyanolichens due to rising air pollution; we are \nespecially interested in the role of sulfur dioxide on cyanolichen biology. \nCyanolichens due to air pollution including sulfur dioxide exposure, show \nsymptomatic changes including degradation of chlorophyll, lipid membrane \nperoxidation, decrease in ATP production, changes in respiration rate, and \nalteration of endogenous auxins and ethylene production, although symptoms are \nknown to vary with species and genotype. Sulfur dioxide has been shown to be \ndamaging to photosynthesis but is relatively benign on nitrogen fixation which \nproposes as a hypothesis that the algal partner may be more in harm's way than \nthe cyanobiont. In fact, the Nostoc cyanobiont of sulfur dioxide-susceptible \nLobaria pulmonaria carries a magnified set of sulfur (alkane sulfonate) \nmetabolism genes capable of alkane sulfonate transport and assimilation, which \nwere only unraveled by genome sequencing, a technology unavailable in the \n1950-2000 epoch, where most physiology- based studies were performed. There is \nworldwide a growing corpus of evidence that sulfur has an important role to play \nin biological symbioses including rhizobia-legumes, mycorrhizae-roots and \ncyanobacteria-host plants. Furthermore, the fungal and algal partners of L. \npulmonaria appear not to have the sulfonate transporter genes again providing \nthe roles of ambient-sulfur (alkanesulfonate metabolism etc.) mediated functions \nprimarily to the cyanobacterial partner. In conclusion, we have addressed here \nthe role of the atmospheric pollutant sulfur dioxide to tripartite cyanolichen \nviability and suggest that the weaker link is likely to be the photosynthetic \nalgal (chlorophyte) partner and not the nitrogen-fixing cyanobiont.\n\n\u00a9 2023.

Lichen mycobionts can reduce ROS formation by \nsynthesizing light-screening pigments such as melanins in the upper cortex, \nwhile the photobionts can dissipate excess energy radiationlessly using \nnon-photochemical quenching (NPQ). An inherent problem with using fluorimetry \ntechniques to compare NPQ in pale and melanised thalli is that NPQ is normally \nmeasured through a variously pigmented upper cortex. Here we used a dissection \ntechnique to remove the lower cortices and medullas of Lobaria pulmonaria and \nCrocodia aurata and then measure NPQ from the underside of the thallus. Results \nconfirmed that NPQ can be satisfactorily assessed with a standard fluorimeter by \ntaking measurement from above using intact thalli. However, photobionts from the \nbottom of the photobiont layer tend to have slightly lower rates of PSII \nactivity and lower NPQ than those at the top, i.e., display mild \"shade\" \ncharacteristics.

Nonetheless, their effects in \nother terrestrial ecosystems have not been well studied. As a result of \noxidative stress in organisms exposed to high levels of antibiotics, \ngenotoxicity can lead to DNA damage and, potentially, cell death. In addition, \nin symbiotic organisms, removal of the associated microbiome by antibiotic \ntreatment has been observed to have a big impact on the host, e.g., corals. The \nlung lichen Lobaria pulmonaria has more than 800 associated bacterial species, a \nmicrobiome which has been hypothesized to increase the lichen's fitness. We \nartificially exposed samples of L. pulmonaria to antibiotics and a stepwise \ntemperature increase to determine the relative effects of antibiotic treatments \nvs. temperature on the mycobiont and photobiont gene expression and the \nviability and on the community structure of the lichen-associated bacteria. We \nfound that the mycobiont and photobiont highly reacted to different antibiotics, \nindependently of temperature exposure. We did not find major differences in \nbacterial community composition or alpha diversity between antibiotic treatments \nand controls. For these reasons, the upregulation of stress-related genes in \nantibiotic-treated samples could be caused by genotoxicity in L. pulmonaria and \nits photobiont caused by exposure to antibiotics, and the observed stress \nresponses are reactions of the symbiotic partners to reduce damage to their \ncells.

The search for compounds that can be used to treat \ncancer among various plants and fungi has been intensifying in recent years. In \nlight of this, we describe an HPLC HILIC analytical method for the evaluation of \nthe content of the anticancer compound ergosterol (ERG) and the neuroactive \nalkaloids ibotenic acid (IBO) and muscimol (MUS) that contribute significantly \nto the unpleasant physiological syndrome associated with A. muscaria \nconsumption. A 'homemade' A. muscaria tincture made using 80-proof rye vodka as \nthe solvent, an A. muscaria extract made with a standardized water-ethanol \nsolution as the solvent, and fractions obtained from the second extract via \nliquid-liquid extraction with nonpolar solvents were analyzed. The study also \npresents the results of capillary zone electrophoresis with contactless \nconductivity detection and UHPLC-MS/MS analyses of the IBO and MUS content of \nthe two native A. muscaria extracts and an evaluation of the standardized \nextract's cytotoxic effect against a small panel of lung cell cultures in vitro. \nOur results show that the standardized extract has a significant cytotoxic \neffect and does not contain the compounds of interest in any significant \nquantity.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/molecules28196824\nPMCID: PMC10574166\nPMID: 37836667 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflict of interest.

Amanita muscaria has been ingested as a treatment \nfor a variety of ailments for centuries, most notably those affecting the \ncentral nervous system and conditions associated with neuroinflammation. \nHowever, the effects of these extracts on neuroinflammatory cells, such as \nmicroglia, are unknown. The effect of commercially-sourced A. muscaria extract \n(AME-1) on human microglial cell line (HMC3) expression of surface receptors \nsuch as CD86, CXCR4, CD45, CD125 and TLR4 was determined by flow cytometry. \nAME-1 upregulated expression of all of these receptors. The effect of AME-1 on \nHMC3 production of IL-8 and IL-6 was determined and compared to tumor necrosis \nfactor (TNF), polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)], substance P and \nlipopolysaccharide (LPS), all known activators of HMC-3 and primary microglia. \nHMC3 produced both IL-8 and IL-6 when activated with LPS, TNF and poly(I:C) but \nnot when they were activated with substance P. Although AME-1 at higher \nconcentrations increased IL-8 production of HMC3 on its own, AME-1 notably \npotentiated HMC3 production of IL-8 in response to poly(I:C). AME-1 altered \nexpression of toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) mRNA but not surface protein by HMC3. \nAME-1 also did not significantly alter expression of retinoic acid-inducible \ngene I (RIG-I) or melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), both \ncytosolic sensors of dsRNA. Metabolomics analysis showed that AME-1 contained \nseveral metabolites, including the autophagy inducer, trehalose. Like AME-1, \ntrehalose also potentiated HMC3 poly(I:C) mediated production of IL-8. This \nstudy suggests that A. muscaria extracts can modify HMC3 inflammatory responses, \npossibly due to their trehalose content.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2023 Wagner, Pehar, Yan and Kulka.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fphar.2023.1102465\nPMCID: PMC10130647\nPMID: 37124206\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.",

To increase the \nknowledge of prevalence, treatment and outcome in dogs, information regarding \nmushroom ingestion was collected.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study analysed all inquiries of \nmushroom ingestion in dogs to the Norwegian Poison Information Center from 2011 \nto 2022. Mushrooms were identified by a mycologist or Norwegian-certified \nmushroom expert. Differences in mushroom species, clinical findings, treatments \nand outcome were evaluated.\nRESULTS: A total of 421 mushroom ingestions in dogs were included. The mushrooms \nwere identified as non-poisonous in 45% of cases. The most frequently involved \ntoxin group was gastrointestinal mushrooms, followed by muscarinic mushrooms and \nmushrooms containing isoxazoles. About 64% of cases were managed at home, 33% \nwere hospitalised and received treatment, and 3% were observed by a veterinarian \nwithout treatment. The survival rate was 98.6%, with death occurring after \ningestion of Amanita muscaria, Cortinarius rubellus, Amanita virosa, Clitocybe \nrivulosa and Inocybe sp.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the importance of rapid and accurate \nidentification of the mushroom.

The mushroom is distributed worldwide and ingestions occur with some \nfrequency. Although these ingestions have traditionally been considered benign, \nserious complications can occur. We present 2 cases of serious toxicity, \nincluding a fatality. The first case was a 44-y-old man who presented to the \nemergency department (ED) after cardiopulmonary arrest approximately 10 h after \ningesting 4 to 5 dried A muscaria mushroom caps, which he used for their \nmind-altering effects. Despite successful resuscitation, he remained \nunresponsive and hypotensive and died 9 days later. The second case was a \n75-y-old man who presented to the ED after accidentally consuming one large A \nmuscaria mushroom cap he foraged in Eastern Turkey. The patient initially \npresented to the ED with hallucinations followed by lethargy, and he was \nintubated for airway protection. The patient's condition gradually improved, and \nhe made a full recovery. A muscaria ingestion should not be considered benign as \nserious outcomes do occur.

Sporocarps from the lead smelter-polluted area near \nP\u0159\u00edbram (Central Bohemia, Czech Republic) showed elevated concentrations of Cd \nand Zn. Size exclusion chromatography of the cell extracts of the sporocarps \nfrom both polluted and unpolluted sites indicated that substantial part of \nintracellular Cd and Zn was sequestered in 6-kDa complexes, presumably with \nmetallothionein(s) (MT). When the cultured mycelial isolates were compared, \nthose from P\u0159\u00edbram were more Cd-tolerant and accumulated slightly less Cd and Zn \nthan those from the unpolluted site. The analysis of the available A.muscaria \nsequence data returned a 67-amino acid (AA) MT encoded by the AmMT1 gene. Weak \nCd and Zn responsiveness of AmMT1 in the mycelia suggested its metal homeostasis \nfunction in A.muscaria, rather than a major role in detoxification. The AmMT1 \nbelongs to a ubiquitous peptide group in the Agaricomycetes consisting of \n60-70-AA MTs containing seven cysteinyl domains and a conserved histidyl, \nfeatures observed also in a newly predicted, atypical 45-AA RaMT1 of the \nZn-accumulator Russula bresadolae in which the C-terminal cysteinyl domains VI \nand VII are missing. Heterologous expression in metal-sensitive yeast mutants \nindicated that AmMT1 and RaMT1 encode functional peptides that can protect cells \nagainst Cd, Zn, and Cu toxicity. The metal protection phenotype observed in \nyeasts with mutant variants of AmMT1 and RaMT1 further indicated that the \nconserved histidyl seems to play a structural, not metal binding role, and the \ncysteinyls of the C-terminal domains VI and VII are important for Cu binding. \nThe data provide an important insight into the metal handling of site-associated \nectomycorrhizal species disturbed by excess metals and the properties of MTs \ncommon in Agaricomycetes.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.

        "summary": "Amanita muscaria, commonly known as the fly agaric or fly amanita, is a basidiomycete of the genus Amanita. Native throughout the temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, Amanita muscaria has been unintentionally introduced to many countries in the Southern Hemisphere, generally as a symbiont with pine and birch plantations, and is now a true cosmopolitan species. It associates with various deciduous and coniferous trees.\nArguably the most iconic toadstool species, the fly agaric is a large white-gilled, white-spotted, usually red mushroom, and is one of the most recognizable and widely encountered in popular culture, including in video games\u2014for example, the extensive use of a recognizable Amanita muscaria in the Mario franchise and its Super Mushroom power-up\u2014and television\u2014for example, the houses in The Smurfs franchise.Despite its easily distinguishable features, Amanita muscaria is a fungus with several known variations, or subspecies. These subspecies are slightly different, some having yellow or white caps, but they are all usually called fly agarics, and they are most of the time recognizable by their notable white spots. Recent DNA fungi research, however, has shown that some of these variations are not the same species at all, such as the peach-colored fly agaric (Amanita persicina) for example, but the name 'fly agaric' is still commonly used.\nAlthough poisonous, death due to poisoning from A. muscaria ingestion is quite rare. Parboiling twice with water draining weakens its toxicity and breaks down the mushroom's psychoactive substances; it is eaten in parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. All Amanita muscaria varieties, but in particular A. muscaria var. muscaria, are noted for their hallucinogenic properties, with the main psychoactive constituents being muscimol and its neurotoxic precursor ibotenic acid. A local variety of the mushroom was used as an intoxicant and entheogen by the indigenous peoples of Siberia.\n\n",

It is commonly known as the latticed stinkhorn, the basket stinkhorn, or the red cage, alluding to the striking fruit bodies that are shaped somewhat like a round or oval hollow sphere with interlaced or latticed branches. The fungus is saprobic, feeding off decaying woody plant material, and is often found alone or in groups in leaf litter on garden soil, grassy places, or on woodchip garden mulches. Although considered primarily a European species, C. ruber has been introduced to other areas, and now has a wide distribution that includes all continents except Antarctica. The species was illustrated in the scientific literature during the 16th century, but was not officially described until 1729.\nThe fruit body initially appears like a whitish \"egg\" attached to the ground at the base by cords called rhizomorphs. The egg has a delicate, leathery outer membrane enclosing the compressed lattice that surrounds a layer of olive-green spore-bearing slime called the gleba, which contains high levels of calcium that help protect the fruit body during development. As the egg ruptures and the fruit body expands, the gleba is carried upward on the inner surfaces of the spongy lattice, and the egg membrane remains as a volva around the base of the structure. The fruit body can reach heights of up to 20 cm (7.9 in). The color of the fruit body, which can range from pink to orange to red, results primarily from the carotenoid pigments lycopene and beta-carotene. The gleba has a fetid odor, somewhat like rotting meat, which attracts flies and other insects to help disperse its spores. Although the edibility of the fungus is not known with certainty, its odor would deter most from consuming it. C. ruber was not regarded highly in tales in southern European folklore, which suggested that those who handled the mushroom risked contracting various ailments.",

To this purpose, four epiphytic (tree inhabiting) lichen species \n(Evernia prunastri, Flavoparmelia caperata, Parmotrema perlatum, Ramalina \nfarinacea) were collected from the Babouch forests, a remote and unpolluted area \nof NW Tunisia, and analyzed for their content of potentially toxic elements \n(PTEs), namely Al, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb, Sb, and Zn, by ICP-MS. Moreover, \nalso the physiological status of the lichen samples was evaluated by measuring \ntheir chlorophyll content, photosynthetic efficiency, and spectral reflectance. \nThe results indicated a remarkable contribution of airborne soil and dust \nparticles to the total PTE content, especially for the foliose species F. \ncaperata and P. perlatum.

To assess their capacity for Hg uptake and accumulation, \nwe determined the concentration of gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) in air and \nthe concentration of total Hg (THg) in transplanted thalli of two lichen \nspecies. Lichen transplants and passive air samplers (PASs) were concurrently \ndeployed, side by side, at 10 sites within an abandoned mining area, \ncharacterized by large gradients in atmospheric Hg contamination. Highly \nvariable time-weighted GEM concentrations determined by the PASs, ranging from \n17 to 4,200\u00a0ng/m3, were mirrored by generally high Hg concentrations in \ntransplanted thalli of both Xanthoria parietina (174-8,800\u00a0ng/g) and Evernia \nprunastri (143-5,500\u00a0ng/g). Hg concentrations in the two species co-varied \nlinearly indicating about 60% greater Hg accumulation in X. parietina than in E. \nprunastri. Whereas Hg uptake in the fruticose E. prunastri increased linearly \nwith GEM, a power law equation with a fractional exponent described the uptake \nin the foliose X. parietina. Extrapolating the relationships observed here to \nhigher GEM levels yielded concentrations in lichen that agree very well with \nthose measured in an earlier fumigation experiment performed under \nlaboratory-controlled conditions. The uptake model of X. parietina was further \nverified by correctly estimating GEM concentrations from the THg measured in \nautochthonous thalli collected from the urban area adjacent to the mine site. \nPassive sampling can effectively provide time-weighted data of suitable spatial \nresolution to quantitatively describe GEM assimilation by lichens. Therefore, \nthe combined use of passive sampling and lichen transplants can contribute to a \nmore comprehensive understanding of the role of lichens, and potentially also of \nother cryptogams, in the deposition of atmospheric Hg to terrestrial ecosystems.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

While thin layer chromatography \nis still the preferred analysis method for most lichenologists, liquid \nchromatography gives a deeper insight in the lichen metabolome, but an \nextractive step is needed before any analysis. Therefore, ambient ionization \nmass spectrometry (MS) analysis of lichen samples using Atmospheric Solid \nAnalysis Probe (ASAP) and Direct Acquisition in Real Time (DART) techniques is \nevaluated.\nOBJECTIVE: We looked for a faster method to screen the metabolome by disrupting \nthe classical workflow of analysis.\nMETHODS: Four lichens selected for their metabolic diversity were analyzed with \nMS; namely Evernia prunastri, Lichina pygmaea, Parmelia saxatilis, and Roccella \nfuciformis. ASAP and DART analyses were compared against the reference \nelectrospray ionization with a bioinformatic process including Van Krevelen \ndiagrams as well as the multivariate comparison of the ionization methods in \npositive and negative modes.\nRESULTS: Metabolite profiles obtained from DART and ASAP analyses of lichen \nsamples are consistent with classical analyses of lichen extracts. Through an \neasy and rapid experiment and without any extraction solvent, a large and \ninformative profile of lichen metabolites is obtained when using complementary \nionization modes of these high resolution mass spectrometry methods.\nCONCLUSION: ASAP-MS and DART-MS are two ancillary methods that provide a \ncomprehensive evaluation of the lichen metabolome.\n\n\u00a9 2022 The Authors.

The concentrations of trace elements Hg, Se, \nV, Mo, and Ba were analyzed by ICP-MS in four lichens: Xanthoria calcicola, \nXanthoria parietina, Ramalina pollinaria, and Ramalina lacera. To assess the \ncontamination of lichens by trace elements, different environmental indices were \ncalculated: Contamination Index (Ic), Contamination Factor (CF), Pollution Load \nIndex (PLI) and Enrichment Factor (EF). The results revealed that the genus \nRamalina has a low tolerance to polymetallic pollution with a PLI not exceeding \n0.44. The genus Xanthoria seems more resistant to polymetallic pollution with a \nmaximum PLI of 2.58. The calculation of the enrichment factor revealed a very \nstrong enrichment of the lichens in Mo, Hg and Se with a maximum content in Ba \nwhich reflects a strong metallic contamination of various origins especially in \nthe urban and industrial areas of the region.\n\n\u00a9 2023.

This \nstudy basically aims to determine the recent level of airborne heavy metals, \nusing lichen biomonitoring method. The cosmopolitan foliose lichen Xanthoria \nparietina growing abundantly on trees was sampled from 16 urban green spaces in \n8 districts on the Anatolian side of Istanbul. Multi-element analysis by ICP-MS \nwas applied to measure the accumulation of 10 potentially toxic trace elements \nin lichen samples. Spatial distributions of element levels in the air in the \nsampling areas are shown by mapping. According to the analysis data, the \nsequence of element deposition levels in lichen samples was as follows; \nAl\u2009>\u2009Fe\u2009>\u2009Mn\u2009>\u2009Zn\u2009>\u2009Cr\u2009>\u2009Cu\u2009>\u2009Pb\u2009>\u2009V\u2009>\u2009Ni\u2009>\u2009As. Most of the measured atmospheric \nelement amounts yielded results much higher than the reference material in all \nareas. It was detected that the highest pollution in terms of Al, Cu, Fe, Mn, \nand Ni elements was in Elmasburnu Nature Park area in Beykoz district, which is \na touristic place by the sea. Changes in the city's air quality over the years \nhave been evaluated by comparing element levels in these locations in a previous \nbiomonitoring study and some differences were found. The resulting data is \nvaluable for periodic monitoring of toxic elements in the air, for determining \ncauses of air pollution, and for taking precautions.\n\n\u00a9 2023.

The major metals in the heap sludge and in the \nlichens below the heap (Ni, Cr, Fe, Mn, and Co) were surprisingly low in lichens \nfrom both the near and far vicinity of the heap (4-25\u00a0km), indicating limited \nairborne spread. However, two different sites with metallurgical activity \n(another site near the ferroalloy producer in Orava) typically contained the \nhighest amount of individual elements, including rare earth elements, Th, U, Ag, \nPd, Bi and Be, and their separation from other sites was confirmed by PCA and \nHCA analyses. In addition, the amounts of Cd, Ba and Re were highest at sites \nwithout a clear source of pollution and further monitoring is needed. It was \nalso an unexpected finding that the enrichment factor calculated using UCC \nvalues was increased (often considerably >10) for 12 elements at all 15 sites, \nindicating eventual anthropogenic contamination with P, Zn, B, As, Sb, Cd, Ag, \nBi, Pd, Pt, Te and Re (and other EF values were locally increased). Metabolic \nanalyses showed a negative correlation between some metals and metabolites \n(ascorbic acid, thiols, phenols and allantoin), but slightly positive (amino \nacids) or highly positive correlation with purine derivatives hypoxanthine and \nxanthine. The data suggest that lichens adapt their metabolism to excessive \nmetal loading and that epiphytic lichens are suitable for identifying metal \ncontamination even at apparently clean sites.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Automated air quality monitoring stations continuously record airborne \npollutant concentrations, but are restricted in number, costly to maintain and \ncannot document all spatial variability of airborne pollutants. Biomonitors, \nsuch as lichens, are commonly used as an inexpensive alternative to assess the \ndegree of pollution and monitor air quality. However, only a few studies \ncombined lichen carbon, nitrogen and sulfur contents, with their \nstable-isotope-ratio signatures (\u03b413C, \u03b415N and \u03b434S values) to assess spatial \nvariability of air quality and to 'fingerprint' potential pollution sources. In \nthis study, a high-spatial resolution lichen biomonitoring approach (using \nXanthoria parietina and Physcia spp.) was applied to the City of Manchester \n(UK), the centre of the urban conurbation Greater Manchester, including \nconsiderations of its urban characteristics (e.g., building heights and traffic \nstatistics), to investigate finer spatial detail urban air quality. Lichen wt% N \nand \u03b415N signatures, combined with lichen nitrate (NO3-) and ammonium (NH4+) \nconcentrations, suggest a complex mixture of airborne NOx and NHx compounds \nacross Manchester. In contrast, lichen S wt%, combined with \u03b434S strongly \nsuggest anthropogenic sulfur sources, whereas C wt% and \u03b413C signatures were not \nconsidered reliable indicators of atmospheric carbon emissions. Manchester's \nurban attributes were found to influence lichen pollutant loadings, suggesting \ndeteriorated air quality in proximity to highly trafficked roads and densely \nbuilt-up areas. Lichen elemental contents and stable-isotope-ratio signatures \ncan be used to identify areas of poor air quality, particularly at locations not \ncovered by automated air quality measurement stations. Therefore, lichen \nbiomonitoring approaches provide a beneficial method to supplement automated \nmonitoring stations and also to assess finer spatial variability of urban air \nquality.\n\n\u00a9 2023.

Fr. is a widely spread foliose lichen showing high \ntolerance against UV-radiation thanks to parietin, a secondary lichen substance. \nWe exposed samples of X. parietina under simulated Martian conditions for \n30\u00a0days to explore its survivability. The lichen's vitality was monitored via \nchlorophyll a fluorescence that gives an indication for active light reaction of \nphotosynthesis, performing in situ and after-treatment analyses.

Significant \ndifferences in the photo-efficiency between UV irradiated samples and dark-kept \nsamples were observed. Fluorescence values correlated with temperature and \nhumidity day-night cycles. The photo-efficiency recovery showed that UV \nirradiation caused significant effects on the photosynthetic light reaction. \nRaman spectroscopy showed that the carotenoid signal from UV exposed samples \ndecreased significantly after the exposure. TEM observations confirmed that UV \nexposed samples were the most affected by the treatment, showing \nchloroplastidial disorganization in photobionts' cells. Overall, X. parietina \nwas able to survive the simulated Mars conditions, and for this reason it may be \nconsidered as a candidate for space long-term space exposure and evaluations of \nthe parietin photodegradability.\n\n\u00a9 2023.

Understanding the impacts of these compounds and their \ncombinations on non-target organisms is crucial to minimize unintended \nconsequences, while maintaining their use in plant protection. The aim of this \nstudy was to test how long-term spraying with different solutions of natural \nbiostimulator chitosan, synthetic fungicide Switch 62.5 WG, and their \ncombinations affects the physiology of epiphytic lichen Xanthoria parietina \nnaturally occurring in fruit orchards and farmlands. We showed that fungicides \ncomposed of fludioxionil and cypronidil, as well as the combined use of such \nfungicides together with chitosan, can cause the considerable impairment of \nlichen physiology, and these disturbances relate to both algal and fungal \npartners of the symbiotic association. This negative effect was especially \nvisible in the loss of cell membrane integrity, the high level of membrane lipid \nperoxidation, and changes in chlorophyll fluorescence parameters on the last day \nof the experiment. The combined use of these agents also leads to clear \ndisturbances in the functioning of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, which \nwas manifested by increased NADH dehydrogenase activity, while the use of these \ncompounds separately led to a decrease in the activity of this enzyme. We \nconcluded that the regular use of these agents in fruit tree cultivation may \ncause serious ecological consequences for epiphytic lichen communities as a \nresult of the death of lichen thalli. This study suggests that the impact of \nsome plant protection agents, both individually and in combinations, merits \nfurther attention in terms of their impact on non-target fungi.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.

To assess their capacity for Hg uptake and accumulation, \nwe determined the concentration of gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) in air and \nthe concentration of total Hg (THg) in transplanted thalli of two lichen \nspecies. Lichen transplants and passive air samplers (PASs) were concurrently \ndeployed, side by side, at 10 sites within an abandoned mining area, \ncharacterized by large gradients in atmospheric Hg contamination. Highly \nvariable time-weighted GEM concentrations determined by the PASs, ranging from \n17 to 4,200\u00a0ng/m3, were mirrored by generally high Hg concentrations in \ntransplanted thalli of both Xanthoria parietina (174-8,800\u00a0ng/g) and Evernia \nprunastri (143-5,500\u00a0ng/g). Hg concentrations in the two species co-varied \nlinearly indicating about 60% greater Hg accumulation in X. parietina than in E. \nprunastri. Whereas Hg uptake in the fruticose E. prunastri increased linearly \nwith GEM, a power law equation with a fractional exponent described the uptake \nin the foliose X. parietina. Extrapolating the relationships observed here to \nhigher GEM levels yielded concentrations in lichen that agree very well with \nthose measured in an earlier fumigation experiment performed under \nlaboratory-controlled conditions. The uptake model of X. parietina was further \nverified by correctly estimating GEM concentrations from the THg measured in \nautochthonous thalli collected from the urban area adjacent to the mine site. \nPassive sampling can effectively provide time-weighted data of suitable spatial \nresolution to quantitatively describe GEM assimilation by lichens. Therefore, \nthe combined use of passive sampling and lichen transplants can contribute to a \nmore comprehensive understanding of the role of lichens, and potentially also of \nother cryptogams, in the deposition of atmospheric Hg to terrestrial ecosystems.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
